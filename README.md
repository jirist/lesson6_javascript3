### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM Concept

Using JavaScript, the Document Object Model lets developer access and manipulate the content of a webpage. The Document Object Model uses objects corresponding to various HTML elements; the webpage represented by a document object and page elements represented as a tree, with each element being represented by a node. There are many types of nodes, but the most common nodes are element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. In addition to these, the document itself is a node. All element nodes are nested and related to each other, with document node at the top of the tree. The node relationships are being referred as parents, children, and siblings.
