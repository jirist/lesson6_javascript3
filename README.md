### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM Concept

Using JavaScript, the Document Object Model lets developer access and manipulate the content of a webpage. The Document Object Model uses objects corresponding to various HTML elements; the webpage represented by a document object and page elements represented as a tree, with each element being represented by a node. There are many types of nodes, but the most common nodes are element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. In addition to these, the document itself is a node. All element nodes are nested and related to each other, with document node at the top of the tree. The node relationships are being referred as parents, children, and siblings.

2. DOM Events

An event is an action the user has taken. Events can be triggered on any part of an HTML document, whether by a user's interaction or by a browser; some types of events are a mouse hover over an element or click on an element. The Document Object Model provides methods for capturing events so the developer can design actions in response to them.

3. Accessing Objects in the DOM

Each HTML document displayed in a browser becomes a document object. In other words, a document object represents an HTML document displayed in the browser. Homogenized by the World Wide Web Consortium, and well supported by modern browsers, the document object allows access to all document content. Constructed as a tree of objects, the method a document content is structured is called Document Object Model. The most common way to access an HTML element in the document object is to find the element by its id. Another way to find and access HTML elements in the document object is by the elements' tag name or class name.

4. Modifying Objects in the DOM

The Document Object Model defines a structure of documents and the way a document can be modified. Each HTML element is represented by an object, so with the Document Object Model a developer can navigate the structure of the document and modify its elements and content. There are many ways to change existing elements, their content or attributes; for example, the most elementary way to modify a content of an element is by using the innerHTML or textContent property.
